# Additional Notes on Creating Real Data for Testing and Validating 3D Reconstruction Methods from David 3D Scanner

## Description

Most of methods developed in EnCoV deal with 3D reconstruction and require 3D ground-truth shape
to test and validate them. This document gives additional information about how to use the commercial
structured light scanner from David 3D Scanner to reconstruct in 3D the shape of an object and to capture
its texture. A good tutorial provided by David 3D Scanner can be found in the attached folder ''\docs" and
some Matlab codes in the attached folder ''\codes".
